# demo-gpt-user

This repository contains a demo web application that explores the integration of ChatGPT custom actions with an external
system for user registration workflows. It is an experimental project, not intended as a set of best practices. The
application demonstrates how to initiate user registration, send test emails, update user profiles, and contact the
business owner through ChatGPT actions. It highlights the potential of using OpenAPI specifications to configure actions
and establish communication between ChatGPT and external services.
