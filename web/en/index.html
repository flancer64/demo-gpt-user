        <h2>About the Project</h2>
        <p>
            This project demonstrates the integration of a <a
                href="https://chatgpt.com/g/g-6751aefcfe308191b7fb3d4a2fef049b-customgpt-integration-demo">custom
            GPT chat</a> with an external web application.
            You can see how the chat interacts with the application through actions, processing user requests,
            and forwarding them to the web application.

        <h2>Experimental Feature</h2>
        <p>
            The key feature of this project is experimental voice registration and authentication.
            It allows users to input their authentication data (a digital PIN and a password phrase) using their voice.
            This demonstrates the potential of voice interfaces in cases where standard methods, such as OAuth 2.0, are
            not applicable.
        </p>
        <p>
            Although registration is simplified by manually entering an email address, the system also supports
            letter-by-letter email input using voice. This makes the experiment unique and distinguishes it
            from existing solutions.

        <h2>Features</h2>
        <p>
            The demo application provides functionality for new user registration, email verification, profile data
            editing,
            access recovery, and sending test emails. All <a href="features.html">features</a> are available through
            voice interactions with the chat.

        <p>
            This project is an exploration of technological possibilities and is not intended for use as a finished
            business solution.
            However, if you see the potential for such integration in your business, I am ready to offer development and
            implementation of similar solutions tailored to your needs. You can <a href="contact.html">contact me</a>
