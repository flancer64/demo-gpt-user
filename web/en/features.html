        <h2>New User Registration</h2>
        <p>
            Users can register through the chat by providing their details in their native language (either by voice or
            text).
        </p>
        <p>To register, users need to provide the following:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Email address.</li>
            <li>Name.</li>
            <li>Password phrase.</li>
            <li>Preferred application language.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            ChatGPT structures this information and sends it as POST requests to the web service for account creation.
            After registration, the user receives a unique PIN and password phrase.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section class="section" id="email-verification">
        <h2>Email Verification</h2>
        <p>
            To complete the registration, the web service sends a verification email to the provided email address.
            The user confirms their email using the provided link, after which their account is activated,
            granting them access to additional services through actions.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section class="section" id="access-restore">
        <h2>Access Restore and Profile Editing</h2>
        <p>
            Users can request to edit their account data or restore access through the chat by providing their PIN
            (if remembered) or their email address. A one-time link is sent to the provided email, allowing access
            to the editing interface.
        </p>
        <p>Using this link, users can:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Change their name.</li>
            <li>Modify the application's interface language.</li>
            <li>View their PIN code.</li>
            <li>Set a new password phrase.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            This process combines access recovery and profile editing into a simple and secure method for managing
            user accounts.
        </p>
