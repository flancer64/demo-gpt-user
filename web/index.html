    <h1>Welcome to ChatGPT User Integration Demo</h1>
    <p>
        This website demonstrates the integration of ChatGPT with an external web application for managing user
        interactions. The platform showcases how users can register, recover their credentials, and perform specific
        actions within a web system through ChatGPT’s conversational interface.
    </p>
    <p>
        Key features include:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>User Registration:</strong> Securely register users by collecting their email, consent, locale
            preferences, and passphrase via ChatGPT. The system sends verification emails and assigns a unique PIN for
            future authentication.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Password Recovery:</strong> If a user forgets their PIN and passphrase, ChatGPT can request a
            recovery process. The system generates a secure one-time token and sends a link to the registered email,
            allowing the user to reset their credentials.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Email Sending:</strong> Send test emails through ChatGPT by providing your PIN, passphrase, and
            message details, demonstrating the application’s messaging capabilities.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Explore how conversational AI can simplify complex workflows and enhance interactions between users and external
        systems. This demo highlights the potential for creating more efficient and intuitive user experiences with
        ChatGPT.
